as a solar farm developer with national reach ,  pine gate renewables is a company with an eye on the future . 	None
we are intent on contributing to the broad transformation of our nation's energy model because we believe that clean renewable power is both sensible and practical ,  and that locally generated clean energy is not merely an alternative – it is the only way forward . 	None
what we do	None
pine gate renewables plans and builds small utility-scale solar farms that generate clean renewable power for the communities in which they are located . 	About
we position our farms near existing utility connection points ,  and we thoroughly vet our solar farmland to ensure minimum environmental impact . 	None
how does solar development work ? 	None
good from the ground up	None
we also know that the development of clean energy is a collaborative effort ,  and in order to gain widespread adoption ,  it must be profitable for everyone involved . 	None
take me to your landowner page	None
our relationship with utility companies	None
a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy does not require a complete reimagining of our entire energy delivery structure . 	None
in fact ,  the present infrastructure and the experts who maintain it are vital to widespread renewables integration . 	None
as such ,  they are integral to the uninterrupted delivery of clean power during solar farm interconnection . 	None
solid collaborative relationships with local utilities provide us with the opportunity for a transition to clean power where the only noticeable difference on the part of the end user is a potentially lower energy bill . 	None
tell me more about how solar farm development works . 	None
community is at the heart of what we do	None
community-based solar efforts harness the power of collective buying ,  and strategically located solar farms harness the power of optimum orientation . 	None
the fact is that even when people want solar ,  they may not have the finances or the roof orientation to make it a viable option in their lives . 	None
solar farms generate clean energy for delivery at a local level . 	None
because their clean energy is uploaded directly into the existing electricity grid ,  renewables implementation requires little to no effort or expense on the part of the individual . 	None
people working together make great things happen ,  and the widespread adoption of solar cannot happen without a community effort . 	None
we're proud to be a part of this change ,  and we value the support ,  opinions and counsel of the communities in which we serve . 	None

mission	None
our mission is to empower the entrepreneur as a human . 	None
we believe the true opportunity in empowering entrepreneurs is not just to grow a business but to unlock the human spirit ,  which is the most powerful driver of positive change in the world . 	None
that's why empowering cannot just mean raising capital . 	None

today ,  there are over 28 million small business owners who drive 46 % of america's gdp and employ over half our workforce . 	None
but this sector represents less than 1 % of portfolio allocations . 	None
despite all the hoopla lately around financial innovation and venture capital ,  most business owners do not know where to turn for help in raising capital and getting the services they need to grow . 	None
banks have only tightened their lending standards ,  and most new platforms are only focused on consumer products and buzz-worthy coastal-based start-ups . 	None
in other words ,  if you're a small business owner today ,  the financial services you need have never been more out of reach . 	None
that's why we resolved to do things differently . 	None
rather than only meeting the entrepreneur at the register of the transaction ,  we work with our partners to help businesses maximize their fundability ,  thereby cultivating best in class investments for our investors . 	None
core values	None
we build trust over transactions in our relationships . 	None
we do what's best for our entrepreneurs and investors ,  instead of pushing the next hard-sell . 	None
because the trust we earn is our most precious and enduring asset ,  and relationships are not built in a day or over one transaction . 	None
drivers before solutions	None
we care about understanding the underlying cause of a problem ,  not just the symptoms — even when it takes more time . 	None
we've been in the business long enough to know we don't know everything . 	None
but we know how to listen from a place of curiosity and always go back to the root why ? 	None
so we know we're solving the right problem . 	None
integrity is our most important policy . 	None
period . 	None
we believe these tools free us to be more human in what we do — prioritizing the time we spend cultivating trust and empathy ,  being creative and curious . 	None
we measure our success by the real outcomes we help make happen for our entrepreneurs and investors . 	None
we're in it together	None
we never forget that we are all on this mission together — especially when things get difficult . 	None
that includes not only our team ,  but the millions of entrepreneurs ,  partners and investors who are using business to drive positive change in the world . 	None

about the ccj top 250	None
commercial carrier journal has ranked the top for-hire trucking companies since the late 1960 s . 	None
the ccj top 250 is the most comprehensive ranking of active carriers . 	None
our ranking takes into account not only the revenues posted by a trucking company but also its fleet size and employment base . 	None
rankings based strictly on revenues often capture activities that have only an indirect relationship to transportation . 	None
blending revenue ,  equipment and drivers also allows for a reasonable way to capture carriers that decline to disclose revenue . 	None
the ccj top 250 ranking treats all carriers under one umbrella as a single entity ; carriers with significant ownership by an individual ,  family or company but not organized under a single management team are treated separately . 	None
"for a detailed explanation of the ccj top 250 ranking methodology ,  see ""ranking methodology"" to the right . "	None
our presentation of the ccj top 50 continues to evolve . 	None
this year ,  carriers that went out of business or were acquired by other companies in 2013 aren't listed . 	None
instead ,  only active carriers are displayed . 	None
and as we did last year ,  this year's print version of the ccj top 250 information provides only very basic information on the carriers we rank . 	None
virtually all of the underlying data – revenues ,  power units and drivers ,  for example – appear only online at www.ccjtop250.com . 	None
the ccj top 250 begins with data provided by randall- reilly's rigdig business intelligence ( www.rigdig.com/bi ) based on data supplied by carriers to the federal motor carrier safety administration on their required form mcs-150 filings . 	None
because this data can be – although rarely is – as much as a couple of years old and because the mcs-150 does not include information on revenues ,  all carriers included in the ranking were given an opportunity to review fmcsa data for freshness and to supply information not included on the form . 	None
if a carrier declines to verify or update the data that we provide it for review ,  we presume the publicly available data is valid and use it for ranking purposes . 	None
carriers are never allowed to opt out of the ranking . 	None
companies considered for inclusion in the ccj top 250 were ranked from high to low by revenue ,  power units ( weighted based on the type of power unit as discussed below ) and drivers and assigned a rank in each category . 	None
this sum then was ordered to provide the overall ranking assigned to each carrier ,  with the lowest sum receiving the highest rank . 	None
a number of carriers failed to report actual 2013 revenue . 	None
in order to be included in the blended ranking ,  they were assigned – for blended ranking purposes only – a calculated revenue figure determined by multiplying the carrier's total number of power units by the average of the bottom 50 percent of revenue per power unit performers for the companies in that carrier's primary segment . 	None
calculated revenue is discounted by using the average of the bottom 50 percent of performers so that carriers failing to report revenue are not given an undue advantage in the ranking . 	None
calculated revenue almost always will differ from actual revenue ,  of course ,  but the effect on the blended ranking likely is slight . 	None
the power unit ranking ,  which represents an investment as much as a physical-count measure of trucking assets ,  takes into account the difference between tractors and trucks . 	None
the assumption is that a for-hire carrier with 1,000 tractors has a greater investment in equipment than one with 1,000 straight trucks . 	None
for the purpose of the blended rank only ,  a truck was weighted at half the value of a tractor . 	None

About
we are passionately committed to applying our scientific expertise in a revolutionary computational genetic-analysis technology to transform standard next-generation dna sequencing data into actionable information that enables researchers and clinicians to make precision medicine a reality for patients afflicted with life-threatening diseases . 	None
grounded in leading scientific discoveries and an experienced life-science business team ,  genpro provides quantitative biomarker analysis of dna methylation profiles for personalized health diagnostics ,  disease prediction ,  and therapeutic monitoring . 	About
central to our approach is a proprietary analytical and profiling software platform that transforms routine dna genome sequence data into deep insights into the dynamic epigenome of individual patients . 	None
genpro's pioneering discoveries in epigenetic profiling give us the distinctive ability to identify new and important biomarkers for specific disease states . 	None
our epigenetic analysis results provide clinicians and researchers with actionable information that supports faster ,  more confident decision making and enables better outcomes for patient health . 	About
transforming ngs epigenetic data into personalized health answers	None
what we do	None
genpro analytics™ ,  our proprietary ,  specialized software platform ,  employs genome-wide methylation profiling algorithms to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers that scientists and medical professionals can use to predict ,  diagnose ,  and monitor the likelihood and progression of disease in individuals with much more sensitivity ,  specificity ,  accuracy ,  and cost-effectiveness than any other approach available today . 	None
capitalizing on the exponential growth in next-generation sequencing ( ngs ) and the rising interest in and demand for epigenetic-profiling technologies and analysis of ngs data ,  genpro analytics™ drives transformational improvements across the entire ngs value chain while seamlessly integrating with current ngs pipelines and workflows . 	None
the genpro advantage starts with the simple addition of our gdna prep kit to an existing whole-genome sequencing workflow . 	None
the restriction enzymes in this kit are matched to the genpro analytics™ methylation-profiling and biomarker-discovery software algorithms . 	None
together ,  these technologies deliver results and provide answers that are superior to those obtained from the bisulfite oxidation approach typically used today . 	None
our integrated technology :	None
is simpler	None
does not destroy any dna	None
delivers all the whole-genome sequencing data required for variant analyses	None
is less expensive	None
requires only one ngs run ,  not two ( half the cost )	None
as a result of these advances ,  researchers have access to highly sensitive ,  accurate ,  and comprehensive quantified methylation profiles for use in their own multivariate statistical analyses at a fraction of the cost of currently employed technologies . 	None
but more importantly ,  genpro analytics™ quantified methylation profiles enable previously unachievable downstream value generated by the discovery of novel epigenetic biomarkers that directly impact health improvements . 	None
from gdna preparation using the genpro gdna prep kit through the discovery of novel epigenetic biomarkers using genpro analytics™ ,  our portfolio of services comprises a single integrated solution that enables a superior standard ngs whole-genome sequencing strategy without chemically-induced ( bisulfite oxidation ) mutations . 	None
the ngs data produced from our technology can be used in standard genomic studies ( snps ,  indels ,  alleles ,  etc .  )  . 	None
but more importantly ,  we can derive a quantitative dna methylation profile at each cpg location and extract from that data novel epigenetic biomarkers ,  something no one else can do as accurately ,  cost-effectively ,  or quickly . 	None
our approach uses two lines of evidence in the raw sequence read files to reconstruct methylation status ,  resulting in more statistical confidence in our measurements for each cpg site . 	None
sensitivity . 	None
statistical robustness and sensitivity are essential for biomarker discovery and diagnostic applications . 	None
our approach is highly efficient in separating the epigenetic changes that signal shifts in health status from all the genomic noise and variability that exist between individuals . 	None

i was looking into microbial conversion technologies that can potentially take advantage of the natural gas renaissance currently underway and approached dr .  marx to take advantage of his over 17 years' experience with this kind of microbial physiology . 	None
moreover ,  this microbe can offer more than just high quality protein – it can also be a source of valuable biomolecules like the anti-oxidant carotenoids that often give salmon or shrimp their red color . 	None
by first growing enough protein biomass in my barn ,  we ran a pilot feed study with clownfish and smallmouth grunts in collaboration with researchers from the new england aquarium and roger williams university . 	None
the results were quite positive and that set us out on our path to technology development ,  industrial scale-up and feed trials using commercially relevant fish like salmon and trout . 	None
fish farms ,  or aquaculture have grown dramatically worldwide over the last couple of decades . 	None
there is no better way to feed the world's expected 9 billion people other than through advances in agriculture like aquaculture . 	None
not surprisingly ,  there is a need to do things better and i think we can help . 	None

overview	None
medicenna is a clinical stage ,  privately held ,  immuno-oncology company developing first-in-class ,  interleukin-4 empowered cytokines™ ( il4-ecs ) that specifically target the interleukin-4 receptor ( il4 r )  . 	About
the il4 r is over-expressed by 20 different cancers ,  cancer stem cells and immunosuppressive cells of the tumor micro-environment ( tme )  . 	None
medicenna's il4-ecs have the potential to not only purge the tumor but also un-blind the immune system to cancer thereby altering the treatment paradigm for a large majority of cancer patients . 	None
our lead il4-ec ,  mdna55 has been studied in 3 clinical trials in 72 patients with recurrent glioblastoma ( rgbm )  ,  a uniformly fatal form of brain cancer ,  in which it has shown compelling indications of superior efficacy to the current standard of care . 	None
mdna55 has been granted both ,  fast track ( fda ) and orphan drug status ( fda and ema )  . 	None
the company is poised to commence a phase 2 b study with mdna55 in 2015 ,  then seek breakthrough therapy designation ,  and file for accelerated approval for rgbm by 2018 . 	None
our approach to treat brain and other aggressive cancers received strong validation by a recent award of a $ 14.1 m non-dilutive grant from the cancer prevention and research institute of texas ( cprit )  . 	None
in the us alone ,  nearly 23,000 primary malignant tumors of the brain will be diagnosed and cause over 15,000 deaths . 	None
additionally ,  up to 170,000 new cases of primary cancers originating in the lung ,  breast ,  colon and other organs metastasize to the brain . 	None
at metastasis ,  the median survival of untreated patients is 1-2 months and is extended to less then 9 months in patients treated with surgery ,  chemotherapy ,  and radiation . 	None
analysis of over 300 brain tumor biopsies ,  from primary adult and pediatric brain tumors as well as adult metastatic brain tumors ,  consistently show that over 75 % of brain cancer patients over-express the il4 r . 	None
neuroexact™ incorporates our proprietary il4 r targeted drug ( mdna55 )  ,  an il4 r companion diagnostic ,  precision image-guided convection enhanced delivery ( ced ) and real-time monitoring of drug distribution to ensure that our personalized approach will benefit thousands of patients diagnosed with il4 r brain cancers every year . 	None
treatment with neuroexact™ involves direct one-time intra-tumoral infusion of mdna55 using ced in patients that have been diagnosed with il4 r positive brain tumors . 	None
image guided ced provides intra-tumoral delivery with sub-millimeter precision and real-time monitoring ensures uniform distribution of mdna55 into the brain tumor and its infiltrative edges . 	None
this personalized approach by-passes the blood brain barrier ( bbb )  ,  avoids potential systemic side effects and reduces the risk of tumor recurrence – problems that have continued to plague this difficult to treat disease . 	None
neuroexact™ enables high and uniform drug exposure with only a single dose of mdna55 during a minimally invasive surgical intervention . 	None
it does not require a material change in neurosurgical practice as it involves minor adaptation of established procedures such as image guided biopsies ,  stereotactic radiosurgery or deep brain stimulation . 	None
in addition to brain cancers ,  the il4 r is a marker for highly aggressive forms of solid and blood tumors affecting more then a million new cancer patients every year . 	None
the il4/il4 r bias is known to play a central role in the establishment of a robust immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment ( tme )  ,  is expressed by cancer stem cells and is generally associated with poor survival outcomes . 	None
mdna55 and medicenna's next generation fully human il4-ec platform ( mdna56 and mdna57 ) has the potential to mature into an important class of treatments addressing large unmet needs in oncology . 	None
our target centric approach is complemented by our patient centric approach in that ,  by selecting patient populations that have a biased il-4/il4 r profile ,  our il-4 empowered cytokines™ will have a higher probability of clinical ,  regulatory and re-imbursement success . 	None
with a significantly de-risked lead clinical program validated by a $ 14 m grant ,  ripe opportunities for mdna55 first in rgbm and then in numerous cns cancer indications ,  potential for accelerated approval ,  a mechanism of action that will be synergistic with immunotherapies ,  an experienced management team and solid ip ,  we believe that medicenna provides compelling opportunities for growth ,  collaboration and substantial near-term value inflection .

we are applying this knowledge to pharmaceutical development to bring better medicines to patients faster . 	None
innovation in all scientific industries - it is our intention to apply our technology to other areas of science that underpin some of the world's most important industries to meet humanities' pressing challenges . 	None
benevolentai was founded in 2013 by ken mulvany following the sale of proximagen ,  a successful biotech business that ken founded . 	About
the experience of running a biotech ,  a company in an industry entirely reliant on scientific breakthroughs ,  highlighted the challenges of innovating using a process of scientific discovery that had not largely changed for 50 years . 	None
the sheer volume of information available means no scientist ,  or group of scientists ,  can possibly assimilate ,  recall and accurately process all the known facts . 	None
consequently ,  only a fraction of relevant knowledge guides hypotheses and a fundamental bottleneck exists – a rapidly accelerating mismatch between information and humanity's ability to process it . 	None
benevolentai was established to build and apply artificial intelligence to humankind's new natural resource – data ,  and by doing so unlock science's 'hidden knowledge' and turn highly fragmented unstructured and structured information into new insight and usable knowledge . 	About
headquartered in london's knowledge quarter ,  benevolentai is focussed on forging a powerful union between humans ,  technology and science using ai . 	About
the company's purpose is to dramatically accelerate innovation in industries that rely on science-based ideas ,  inventions and products and overcome some of the world's greatest scientific challenges . 	About
benevolentai's initial scientific focus has been in human health ,  specifically rare disease groups in often overlooked areas . 	None
in human health ,  benevolentai has harnessed its technology to make major breakthroughs and accelerate drug development .. 	None
the company has entered into significant license agreements with some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and is beginning its first phase iib clinical study in 2017 . 	None
benevolentbio	None
benevolentbio is focussed on applying the company's technology in the bioscience industries . 	About
the initial focus has been on human health – generating new ideas that have the potential to improve the lives of millions and deliver better medicines to patients faster in currently overlooked areas such as orphan diseases and rare cancers . 	None
we apply our ai to radically improve the efficiency of drug development ,  produce better target selection ,  optimise compounds and draw previously impossible insights from hundreds of millions of associations between biologically meaningful entities and unstructured text . 	About
our world-class scientific team ,  enabled by our proprietary technology has made rapid progress . 	None
we have developed a significant pipeline of drug candidate programmes ranging from early-stage discovery assets to phase iib clinical development assets and are working with major pharmaceutical groups to licence compounds and develop drugs . 	None
benevolenttech	None
benevolenttech is developing an advanced artificial intelligence platform that helps scientists make new discoveries and redefines how scientists gain access to ,  and use ,  all the data available to them to drive innovation . 	About
the technology is built upon a deep judgement system that learns and reasons from the interaction between human judgement and data . 	None
simply put – the technology probe's science's 'hidden knowledge' and deduces what 'should' be known based on what 'is' already known . 	None
the platform ,  and its associated unique systems and designed ai tools ,  generates usable knowledge from vast volumes of unstructured information in scientific papers ,  patents ,  clinical trial information and from a large number of structured data sets . 	None
the technology understands information by employing an array of proprietary deep learning linguistic models and algorithms to analyse and understand context ; then reasons ,  learns ,  explores ,  creates and translates what it has learnt to produce unique hypotheses . 	None
the platform is unlike a typical computing system ,  in that it is not programmed ,  rather it continuously learns on its own from interactions with experts . 	None
benevolentai believes that the way it brings science and computer technology together is unique . 	None
benevolentai combines the power of machine brains with expert human brains to understand the wealth of big ,  complex and ever-changing data . 	None
the technological goal is to augment human judgment - to assist the creative process that characterises the very best scientist . 	About
the technology enables previously impossible scientific discoveries by finding connections that would otherwise have been missed . 	None
the first use case has been applying our software to automate the extraction of biological knowledge ,  undertake predictive and generative biochemistry ,  and advance better therapeutic molecules thus enabling our drug discovery scientists to develop new medicines more efficiently . 	None

take a peak behind door . 	None
flat fees are better	None
door is a real estate brokerage company that leverages technology in order to sell or buy our clients' homes for a flat fee of $ 5,000 per side ,  paid at close . 	About
we believe that the 6 % ( 3 % on the buy side ,  3 % on the sell side ) traditional commission structure for selling/buying a home is a holdover from the days before the internet and is completely divorced from today's reality . 	None
between 90 % and 95 % of consumers now use internet search engines ( zillow ,  trulia ,  etc .  )	None
to find homes . 	None
agents are no longer the gatekeepers between sellers and buyers and there is no need to pay exorbitant commissions to sell or buy a home . 	None
further ,  when you own a home you take significant financial risk to buy it ,  finance it ,  and maintain it . 	None
it is your home equity and you should keep it . 	None
work with a trusted team ,  not an individual	None
we believe the independent contractor model used by traditional real estate brokerages is broken . 	None
because traditional real estate agents do not know when they will get their next paycheck ,  their strongest incentive is to find the next deal ,  not concentrate on yours . 	None
our real estate agents are employees because we believe that hard-working professionals managing what is frequently the largest transaction in a person's life deserve great incomes and a company culture that fosters growth ( both personal and professional ) and learning . 	None
we believe that this model creates a company that is completely client focused . 	None

here's the story of how we came about in the words of our chief headboxer ,  andrew :	None
and the need to find yet another amazing space at very short notice for one of my largest clients who needed to deliver an important stakeholder workshop . 	None
there were endless phone calls ,  emails ,  forms and contracts . 	None
there was a mountain of paper ,  countless trips to the scanner and photocopier and ,  most importantly ,  i spent a lot of time speaking to venue-listing sites who were acting as an intermediary between me and the spaces i wanted to book . 	None
an intermediary and a barrier . 	None
the whole process was alarmingly out-of-date ,  too slow ,  very inefficient and incredibly time consuming . 	None
eventually ,  i found a venue that met all the criteria i was looking for . 	None
but not where i was expecting to find it . 	None
the space i settled on was a very cool private cinema that was sitting empty during the day . 	None
the client loved it - and i got an idea . 	None
scribbled on one of my post-its ,  in a frenzied scrawl ,  was my vision for a company . 	None
a company that would do this very job - unlock thousands of under-utilised spaces ,  opening them up to be used for meetings ,  off-sites and events . 	None
and crucially ,  it would be a website where it made the whole process much ,  easier ,  simpler and faster . 	None
here at headbox we are starting a movement for the renaissance of disused ,  misused and underused space . 	None
headbox cuts out the intermediary . 	None
we connect hosts and guests directly via our platform and in doing so are unleashing many more amazing spaces ,  making them more accessible ,  more available and more affordable . 	None
so ,  let old become new ,  and empty become filled with people ,  ideas and creativity . 	None

it's time to reject the hysteria and embrace the science	None
by ian pigott : harpenden ,  hertfordshire ,  united kingdom	None
contrary to many sensationalist newspaper headlines ,  the world's leading weedkiller doesn't cause cancer in people . 	None
that's the conclusion of the european chemicals agency ( echa )  ,  in a report issued last week . 	None
it's also the thinking of every other regulatory panel that has studied the question ,  an international group that includes the environmental protection agency in the united states ,  the food and agriculture organization of the united nations ,  and the european food safety authority ,  another eu body . 	None
such compelling scientific based evidence is excellent news for the conservation agriculture that i practice on my farm . 	None
farmers around the world rely on safe crop-protection products : tools that help us keep our fields free of weeds and pests . 	None
without them ,  more of our natural landscape would need to be used for growing crops . 	None
it is because we have the ability to defend our crops ,  we can rationalise the amount of land devoted to crop production . 	None
it's also true around the world . 	None
on my farm ,  glyphosate helps me embrace the environmental responsibilities that i so passionately promote . 	None
we practice conservation agriculture ,  which means we combine a rotation of ultra low disturbance zero tillage for our cash crops with planting diverse cover crop mixes with species such as oil radish ,  phacelia ,  rye ,  and buckwheat . 	None
the cover crops increase organic matter ,  improve soil quality ,  help mobilise fertility ,  improve water retention and preserve biodiversity . 	None
once per year ,  we use glyphosate to remove the cover crop ,  into which we then sow the cash crop that follows . 	None
if we weren't able to use glyphosate ,  we would have to abandon conservation agriculture . 	None
this would mean a return to ploughing the soil ,  which destroys the microbiome of beneficial fungi ,  bacteria and archaea that we have so worked hard to establish . 	None
it would also mean we would have to burn more diesel ,  contribute more nitrous oxide pollution to the atmosphere ,  and disrupt the natural habitats we are supporting . 	None
a crop-protection product like glyphosate has an important role in delivering sustainable farming —it also protects the world we inhabit . 	None
farmers have used glyphosate safely for decades ,  but in recent years anti-gmo activists have tried to target the product because it often works in harmony with biotechnology—i.e .,  crops that have been bred through modern science to resist the effects of glyphosate . 	None
their latest attempt involved trying to pressure the eu ,  during its routine re-approval of glyphosate for widespread use ,  to condemn glyphosate as a cancer-causing menace . 	None
the time has come to reject the hysteria and embrace the science : every body that looked into glyphosate has reported that it is perfectly safe for ordinary use . 	None
the echa is merely the latest agency to confirm the consensus . 	None
let's hope that common sense now prevails—and that the eu rejects the political demands of ideologues and reapproves glyphosate for the good of farmers ,  consumers ,  and conservation . 	None

we are a company dedicated to translating state-of-the art science into novel medicines for the treatment of diseases that pose great challenges to patients ,  their physicians and their families . 	About
the very nature of disease is now being understood in molecular terms brought about by the use of powerful technologies that reveal the underlying genetics in diseased cells . 	None
this is especially true for cancer which is fundamentally a disease of gene mutations . 	None
if genetics is the study of inherited variability ,  and genomics the study of the entire complement of each person's dna ,  epigenetics is the science shedding light on the factors that influence gene expression that are not accounted for by classical genetics ,  namely ,  variations in dna . 	None
what is now coming into molecular focus is the mechanism by which the environment talks to the genome and the cell talks back . 	None
this approach has its greatest impact by changing the expression of genes by modifying the environment around dna rather than the dna itself . 	None
the confluence of these three related sciences is providing the insight that is generating a new wave of medicines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases of gene expression . 	None

shao soon joined the aerg to complete his honors thesis as he wanted to reinvent the way traditional tutorials were taught in engineering ,  and adaptive elearning was the key to do so . 	None

we were ,  and still are ,  thankful . 	None
the sparrow ,  in hebrew ,  is the bird of freedom and we really think that education emancipates the mind . 	None
we know that learning is way better when it is adaptive ,  and that there is so much more that software can do for teaching than all those multiple choice quizzes â itâs not even funny . 	None

faradion is pioneering the next generation of advanced ,  low-cost battery materials . 	About
these novel materials employ sodium-ion ( na-ion ) technology which when incorporated into batteries will be virtually indistinguishable ,  in terms of performance ,  from the leading lithium-ion ( li-ion ) products currently on the market . 	None
na-ion batteries have a number of benefits compared to battery technologies already on the market ,  with the foremost advantage being the low cost . 	None
the sodium salts used to prepare these battery materials are highly abundant ,  coming from more sustainable sources than those of equivalent lithium salts ,  making them both cheap and easily obtainable . 	None
if compared to the equivalent salts used to make li-ion batteries ,  the cost is approximately 1/10 th of the cost . 	None
conventional li-ion batteries work by shuttling lithium ions between an anode and a cathode . 	None
scientists used to think that because sodium is larger than lithium ,  it will not be able to undergo this shuttling mechanism as easily . 	None
it is thought that this is because the mobility of the charge carrier ( na+ ) is sensitive to the structure of the active material and sodium's interaction with the structure . 	None
this is supported by recent computational studies by ceder et al . 	None
which indicate that the barriers for diffusion for na+ ion migration can be lower than those of li+ migration in the same structures . 	None
because sodium is heavier than lithium ,  people sometimes think that the energy density will be correspondingly lower . 	None
however ,  sodium makes up a very small proportion of the battery by mass and so ,  on a battery scale ,  the difference in energy density is minimal . 	None
by bringing low-cost ,  state-of-the-art na-ion technology to the market ,  the faradion team are accelerating the introduction of emerging technologies such as stationary storage ( on and off-grid ) and electric vehicles . 	None
with its headquarters at the innovation centre in sheffield ,  faradion has gathered a team of experts in the battery industry ,  with an impressive array of skills and experience . 	None
performance	None
faradion's sodium-ion batteries can be tailored to both energy and power applications ,  depending on your requirements . 	About
stage of technology	None
as a result ,  faradion's ip portfolio covers several ranges of materials ,  providing many novel materials from which to choose ,  depending on the application required . 	None

hello ,  i'm freddie and i'm the founder of patch . 	None
back in 2014 ,  my girlfriend and i moved in together and ,  in my efforts to put my stamp on what was her place ,  i soon made it my mission to turn the bare ,  unloved balcony into an urban garden that we could be proud of . 	None
one long weekend ,  i realised that this was going to be far easier said than done . 	None
firstly ,  i realised that i had no idea what plants i liked nor what kind would be right for our little east-facing balcony . 	None

'surely there's a half-decent online garden centre' ,  i thought . 	None
in the end ,  i bought some plants from a nearby supermarket but ,  within four weeks ,  they were dead . 	None
the plant paradise i had promised to create soon looked rather sorry for itself . 	None
disheartened but still determined ,  i picked up some books ,  got back on the horse named 'gardening' and started learning . 	None
in the meantime ,  i heard more and more of my friends were struggling with the same plant problems that i had been having . 	None
so i thought i'd try to find a way to help them and others like us . 	None
at patch ,  we want to help bring the joy of gardening to anyone and everyone . 	About

during this time of great hardness and terror ,  we were so well cared for with a whole community behind us . 	None
i thought about how truly lucky we were to only have to worry about what was best for jamie and not everything else . 	None

None

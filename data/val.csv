vision	None
ce will bring industrial-scale air capture to market ,  by designing and building the world's first air capture plant . 	About
ce's technology will complement ccs and other mitigation options by capturing atmospheric - not geologic - co2 ,  in order to help manage the 60 % of emissions that do not come from point-sources . 	None
as economies try to meet the daunting technological and policy challenges of making deep reductions in co2 emissions ,  and as industries try to reduce their exposure to emissions-related financial risks ,  air capture will prove to be an attractive option in many markets and sectors . 	None
our best-practice engineering and cost-estimation efforts will allow potential investors and customers to make clear choices on the use of air capture or other mitigation options . 	None
ce's detailed engineering and design work continues to push policy-makers to seriously consider air capture as an attractive tool in tackling long-term climate change impacts . 	None
technology strategy	None
ce's technology strategy is to develop a low-risk ,  chemical-based co2 air capture system that minimizes up-front capital costs . 	About
our approach is to combine and adapt technologies that have been proven to work at industrial scale with our own ip and innovations . 	None
we are focused on minimizing the capital cost of industrial scale pilot plants and the technical risks associated with scale-up —the single biggest barriers to commercialization . 	None
our low technical-risk strategy ,  along with the design commonalities our process shares with proven chemical or mineral-processing industries ( such as pulp & paper )  ,  puts ce's air capture system on the most direct path among competitors to commercialization and deployment at industrial scale . 	About
ce's business strategy is to integrate atmospheric co2 into liquid fuel production ,  in order to leverage near-term premium-value markets for low carbon-intensity fuels . 	About
there are several attractive ways in which co2 can be captured from the atmosphere ,  and integrated into liquid fuel production to produce liquid hydrocarbons that are fully compatible with today's transport infrastructure ,  but have a low ( or even zero ) carbon intensity . 	None
co2 from the atmosphere can be supplied for enhanced oil recovery . 	None
once the produced oil is refined and the fuel is burned ,  the life-cycle carbon intensity is still less than half of today's conventional fuels . 	None
atmospheric co2 can be captured and supplied for algae growth in industrial-scale ponds . 	None
co2 from the atmosphere can be captured and directly synthesized into liquid hydrocarbons . 	None
this approach allows centralized low-carbon head and power to be used for the fuel synthesis ,  and supplies high energy-density liquid fuels to the transportation sector with zero net co2 emissions . 	None
california now has a low carbon fuel standard in effect ,  and similar initiatives are under way in other states ,  british columbia ,  and europe . 	None
these regulations seek to cut co2 emissions by incentivizing transport fuels that have low life-cycle carbon intensity with premium values . 	None
air-capture may be allowed into these markets because it is a direct physical removal of co2 that can be accurately quantified and integrated into the fuel production chain ; if permitted ,  these markets represent compelling market opportunities for air capture . 	None
ce's business strategy is to monetize the value of low-carbon fuels in constrained markets ,  and to combine that with commodity revenue for industrial co2 ,  to finance profitable air capture projects . 	None

what you need to know about applying fall fertilizer	None
to fall fertilize or to not fall fertilize – that is the question many growers in western canada are asking themselves these days as temperatures gradually begin to drop . 	None
even as fertilizer products and application technologies continue to evolve ,  the primary reason to consider fall fertilization remains the same : it helps to spread out a grower's workload more evenly throughout the year and can substantially reduce the stress they feel come springtime . 	None
by applying fertilizer in the fall ,  growers will have more space in their tank for seed and other product in the spring ,  meaning they have the ability to go longer between fill-ups and wrap up seeding that much quicker . 	None
another logistical benefit of fall fertilizing is that once you've applied the product to your field you no longer have to worry about subsequent industry shortages or plant failures that could result in costly interruptions to spring seeding . 	None
it can also result in a cost savings as fertilizer prices tend to be lower in fall than in spring . 	None
an additional advantage of fall fertilizing is that soil is typically drier than in the spring . 	None
drier fall conditions also mean it is easier to incorporate fertilizer rather than simply forcing it to sit on top . 	None
risks with fall fertilizer applications	None
of course ,  that's not to say that fall fertilizing doesn't come with some risks . 	None
because the product can be on the field for as long as six or seven months before it is used by the plant ,  that means there is more potential for something to go wrong such as leaching or denitrification . 	None
these two loss mechanisms have been identified as the main reasons why some growers have gone away from fall fertilization . 	None
you can also lose some of the product to wind and other environmental conditions ,  although those losses are considered acceptable by most standards . 	None
timing is everything	None
if you apply it when the soil is still too warm you run the risk of the nitrogen you are apply converting into other forms and are more likely to see leaching or denitrification . 	None
a simple rule of thumb is to wait until soil temperatures are consistently around the 5 c mark or lower . 	None
by testing prior to fertilizing ,  growers will have a much clearer indication about soil levels and what they need to apply to ensure they are putting the right nutrient in the right place at the right time . 	None
choose the right fertilizer product	None
while there are many options to consider with fall fertilization ,  it's important to remember to choose the right product at the right time to make sure you realize the most benefit . 	None
the best place to start is by speaking to you agronomist for advice on choosing the right product for the job . 	None

about investfit™ ed 2017-03-22 t14 : 02 : 31+00 : 00	None
what is investfit™ ? 	None
investfit™ is powerful and unique because it uses your client's individual circumstances together with its simulation and optimisation engines to identify the best investment strategy that maximises their financial outcomes . 	None
investfit™ uses the latest and most sophisticated financial technology . 	None
traditional financial advice ,  based on spreadsheets that use expected average investment returns have about a 50 % chance of being correct . 	None
in other words there is a 50 % chance that our retirement income will be less than the figure shown in the advice . 	None
investfit™ ,  on the other hand ,  allows for the fact that investment returns vary from one year to the next and that it is not unusual to have a sequence of poor returns over a number of years ,  particularly for shares . 	None
investfit™ projects these variations in investment returns and also takes into account the correlations between interest rates ,  inflation ,  property prices and share prices — that is ,  the tendency for them to move together or in opposite directions . 	None
"investfit™ also models a huge number of possible strategies ,  rather than just the one that has been selected by default or based on a subjective ""risk"" questionnaire . "	None
by doing this ,  investfit™ is able to allow your client to choose the level of certainty needed when planning for the client's financial future and then to find the investment strategy that maximises your client's goals within the chosen level of certainty . 	None
you can also change goals as the program reveals what is possible for your client's retirement . 	None
for example ,  you might find that a client can have 90 % certainty of a retirement income of $ 80,000 per year so long as they don't plan to leave an inheritance . 	None
but suppose they want to leave an inheritance of $ 200,000 ,  is that possible ? 	None
well ,  investfit™ will answer that and how to do it . 	None
it might mean the client accepts a lower retirement income ,  say $ 75,000 ,  or retiring two years later ,  or making additional savings . 	None
investfit™ projects your client's financial future thousands of times for over 10,000 possible investment strategies . 	None

about influenza	None
about influenza	None
"influenza ,  commonly known as ""the flu"" ,  is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus that is spread by droplet transmission through the air from coughs and sneezes or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus . "	None
symptoms can be mild to severe with the most common including a high fever ,  runny nose ,  sore throat ,  muscle pains ,  headache ,  coughing ,  and feeling tired . 	None
these symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week . 	None
more severe complications of influenza include viral pneumonia ,  secondary bacterial pneumonia ,  sinus infection ,  and exacerbation of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure ; these severe complications can lead to hospitalization and death . 	None
this is in contrast to other commonly used vaccines ,  such as measles vaccine that show 93 % protection after a single dose . 	None
influenza spreads around the world in a yearly outbreak ,  resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide . 	None
death occurs mostly in the young ,  the old and those with other health problems . 	None
larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent . 	None
in the 20 th century three influenza pandemics occurred : spanish influenza in 1918 ,  asian influenza in 1958 ,  and hong kong influenza in 1968 ,  each resulting in more than a million deaths . 	None
the world health organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza a/h1 n1 to be a pandemic in june 2009 . 	None
like other serious viruses and diseases ,  our best defense against influenza is to develop an effective vaccine that maximizes the body's ability to recognize ,  attack and destroy the invading flu strains . 	None
this is no easy task ,  as each year the influenza virus changes and influenza has the ability to mutate ,  even between species . 	None
"traditionally ,  manufacturers have had to make informed ""guesses"" about which strains might be the current season's threat and prepare vaccines accordingly . "	None
often they perform well ,  but when they don't –or when they have limited efficacy — many are at risk . 	None
flugen is working hard to create a better ,  more effective influenza vaccine . 	About
"we believe that we're on the path to create a ""universal"" vaccine ,  one that shows increased efficacy and cross protection against multiple flu strains . "	About

harnessing the immune system to fight disease	None
immune design	None
we are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company with next-generation in vivo approaches designed to enable the body's immune system to fight disease . 	About
although we believe our approaches have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas ,  we are focused in oncology and have engineered our technologies to activate the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic t cells ,  or ctls ,  to fight cancer . 	None
our immuno-oncology product candidates are being developed in two separate approaches : one that targets specific antigens and/or epitopes ( such as cmb305 and in our neoantigen collaboration ) ; and an alternative approach that leverages the endogenous antigens found in the tumor microenvironment via intratumoral immunization ( such as g100 )  . 	None
the specific antigen approach uses selected antigens that are also present in the patient's tumor so that the immune system will be educated to recognize the tumor antigen and kill tumor cells expressing the antigen . 	None
the intratumoral immunization approach ,  in contrast ,  does not require pre-identifying a selected antigen present in the tumor . 	None
it instead relies on treatments such as chemotherapy or local radiation to lyse tumors and release endogenous antigens ,  which are then captured by neighboring g100-activated dendritic cells ,  and is intended to generate a broad and varied immune response . 	None
"although they have distinct mechanisms of action ,  we designed both cmb305 and g100 to convert ""cold"" tumors ,  or those without ctls ,  to ""hot"" tumors ,  or those with ctls specific for the antigens expressed by the tumor . "	None
while our primary focus is immuno-oncology ,  we believe that our platforms also have therapeutic potential in infectious and allergic diseases ,  and have multiple collaborations in place with global pharmaceutical companies leveraging the glaas platform . 	About
we look to our partnerships to provide potential downstream economics while preserving growth opportunities in the future . 	None
